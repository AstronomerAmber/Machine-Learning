# Machine-Learning
## Machine Learning in Astronomy

In this program we will be using supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to classify SDSS data as either a Star, Galaxy or Quasar. This SDSS data is preclassified photometric data. 

In this demo we will use the input features: color and redshift, to train multiple ML classifiers.

The classifiers from Sckit-learn include:

### KNeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Machines (with linear and RBF kernals), a Decision Tree classifier and KMeans clustering.

*Each classifier is evaluated using a confusion matrix
